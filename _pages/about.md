I'm a Computer Science PhD student at [Yale University](https://yale.edu) advised by Prof. [Arman Cohan](https://armancohan.com/).

Previous I received by B.Sc. from [Sharif University of Technology](https://sharif.edu). At Sharif, I have been a member of Prof. [Rohban](https://sharif.ir/~rohban/)'s [RIML lab](https://github.com/rohban-lab) since 2022. There, I have been working on various projects in the fields of adversarial robustness, outlier detection, and backdoor detection.

In Summer 2024, I was a research intern at [Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html) under the supervision of Dr. [Pin-Yu Chen](https://sites.google.com/site/pinyuchenpage/home) and Prof. [Tsung-Yi Ho](https://tsungyiho.github.io/), working on jailbreaks in LLMs.
